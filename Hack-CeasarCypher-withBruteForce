message = 'guv6Jv6Jz!J6rp5r7Jzr66ntrM'
Symbols = 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890 !?.'

# Loop through every possible key:
for key in range(len(Symbols)):
    # It is important to set translated to the blank string so that the
    # previous iteration's value for translated is cleared:

   # The rest of the program is almost the same as the Caesar program:

   # Loop through each symbol in message:
    for symbol in message:
        if symbol in Symbols:
          symbolIndex = Symbols.find(symbol)
            translatedIndex = symbolIndex - key
             # Handle the wraparound:
            if translatedIndex < 0:
                 translatedIndex = translatedIndex + len(Symbols)

             # Append the decrypted symbol:
             translated = translated + Symbols[translatedIndex]
         else:
            # Append the symbol without encrypting/decrypting:
            translated = translated + symbol

     # Display every possible decryption:
